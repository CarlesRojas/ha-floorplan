# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are listed here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the versions
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Write every change under Unreleased as you make it. The release workflow
moves that section under the new version and uses it as the release notes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The card's editor tab shows how to rotate, pan and zoom the view, with the mouse buttons or the finger gestures the device uses.

### Changed

- The space around the home is a dark gray instead of a dark blue.
- Daylight is dimmer, so the lamps still stand out during the day.
- Scrolling over the card no longer zooms it, so a page can be scrolled past it. The mouse zooms by dragging with the wheel pressed.

### Fixed

- Dragging with a finger turns the camera at half the speed it did, so a touch drag no longer spins the home around.
- A two finger gesture now either pans or zooms, chosen by how it starts, instead of doing both at once.
- Starting a pinch no longer jumps the camera back to its saved view.
- Turning a light on or off no longer freezes the card for a moment while the shaders for the new lighting are built.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-27

### Changed

- The card's background is always dark, whatever the Home Assistant theme, so the lights in the home stand out.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- A 3D model of your home drawn from rooms you trace on a plan.
- A catalog of furniture, lights, appliances, doors, windows and sensors, each in several styles.
- Devices from Home Assistant bound to the pieces that stand for them, so a click on a piece controls the device and the piece shows its state.
- A visual editor inside the card's dialog: draw rooms, place and move pieces, bind devices, try states.
- Saved camera views: the one the card opens with and one per room that a click on its floor flies to. A second click on that floor, or a click on the empty space around the home, brings the camera back.
