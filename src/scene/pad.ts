// lamp still came on a second or two late the first time, and the card
// stuttered while it waited.
//
// So the counts are held to a few steps. The lights that are on are topped
// up with dark ones to the next step, and as many of those cast a shadow as
// it takes to keep the shadows at the budget. A lamp switched on or off then
// mostly lands on the step the scene is already at, with every shader built.
// The steps next to it are built in the background, see `ahead`, so the lamp
// that does cross a step finds its shaders waiting too.

// counts go in steps rather than every lamp staying in the scene for good.
