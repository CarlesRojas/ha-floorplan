// The frame is drawn into a buffer and finished from there, in a few steps:
//
// Ambient occlusion darkens where things meet, the foot of a wall, under a
// sofa, the corner of a shelf, which is the shading a small model most
// misses. Without it the flat reads as cut-outs standing on a floor.
//
// Tone mapping then brings the range of light down to what the screen can
// show. Three applied the same filmic curve on its own when it drew to the
// screen; drawing into a buffer turns that off, so it is done here.
//
// Drawing into a buffer loses the antialiasing the screen gave for free, so
// edges are smoothed again at the end.
//
// In the editor, whatever is picked is traced in blue, the 3D version of the
// blue the plan draws it in. The edge is the object's own silhouette, so a
// sofa is outlined as a sofa rather than as the box around it, and where
// something stands in front of it the edge carries on, fainter.
//
// In the card, a room that is focused stands alone, and the rest of the home
// fades away around it. Fading the things themselves would make every
// material see through, which is a shader of its own for each, built on the
// first fade while the card stalls. So the fade is of the finished picture
// instead: for as long as it lasts the frame is drawn twice, the whole home
// and then the room alone laid over it, more and more of it. Either picture
// is drawn with the shaders the scene already has.
