// event only updates what that dialog holds in memory. It reaches the
// dashboard when the dialog's Save is pressed. So Save & Close in the
// fullscreen editor looked like it saved, but closing HA's dialog after it,
// to leave visibility and layout alone, threw the whole edit away.
//
// The dialog is handed a saveCardConfig function by whatever opened it, and
// its own Save calls exactly that and nothing else. Calling it from here
// saves through HA's own path, so the dashboard it holds in memory is
// updated too and nothing later writes an older copy over it. Then the
// dialog's dirty baseline is reset to what was saved, so closing it does
// not ask about unsaved changes and its Save has nothing left to do. The
// dialog itself stays open, for visibility and layout.
//
// This reaches into the dialog's internals. Anything that is not there, on
// an older or a newer Home Assistant, falls back to the old behaviour rather
// than guessing.
